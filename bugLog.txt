adding showAvailableMoves functionality to rook:
adding a rook and selecting it makes it bug. adding a queen and then selecting the queen bugs. but after adding the queen, 
THEN the rook works???????????????????????????????

SOLUTION:
one of my functions was reading the id of a square, and to check that it was valid it was checking that the 2nd character in the element's id.
however when generating an id to the left of the board, it would write it in the form "x-1-y2" so the charAt(1) was not a number.




new game button lets you select a square without pieces one
SOLUTION:
had to reset "pieces" variable when newgame is clicked


pawn was able to kill anything in front of it
SOLUTION:
showAvailableMoves function was working so that if an enemy piece is in the selected piece's path, it can kill. this rule however does not apply to pawns.
had to use conditionality to stop the pawn from following the same rules here as the rest of the pieces.
