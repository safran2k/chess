adding showAvailableMoves functionality to rook:
adding a rook and selecting it makes it bug. adding a queen and then selecting the queen bugs. but after adding the queen, 
THEN the rook works???????????????????????????????

SOLUTION:
one of my functions was using 




new game button lets you select a square without pieces on: had to reset "pieces" variable when newgame is clicked
