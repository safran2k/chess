STEP 1:
Create basic homepage of website, include header bar that allows you to start a new game. Include section in center for where chess board will be.

STEP 2:
Style homepage and make it look pleasant. Create black-square and white-square classes for background colours.

STEP 3:
Write javascript that will generate the board. Add colour classes to each square

STEP 4:
Add classes that will be assigned when any square has a certain piece on it. Will probably have to find image files later. Class for each piece

STEP 5:
Make classes for black/white pieces.

STEP 6:
Make function that will populate the board with pieces by assigning classes to the correct sqaures. Make each of these classes reference 
the corresponding piece image 

STEP 7:
Add logic for each piece, such that when clicked they will be "selected". Also highlight the moves that are available to that piece. Make a function 
that can read which piece has been selected, and then update the available squares accordingly.
